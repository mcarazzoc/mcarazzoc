👋 Hi there! My name is Maurício and I'm an Electrical Engineer based in Brazil. I graduated from UFSM with a focus on power systems and electromagnetism.

Currently, I work in the R&D department at WEG Equipamentos Eletricos S/A, where I collaborate on product line development and perform simulations using Ansys Maxwell. 📚📝

I am passionate about programming because it allows me to automate tasks and improve efficiency. Additionally, I have a strong interest in electromagnetism, electronics, and electrical machines. 🤖💡

In this repository, I keep notes on things that I find useful and that may be helpful to others.
