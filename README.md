Who am I? 

👋 Hi, there! My name is Maurício and I live in Brazil. I've graduated at Electrical Engineering at UFSM ⚡.

Currently I'm working at the R&D department at WEG Weg Equipamentos Eletricos S/A. I colaborate at product line development and go for simulations at Ansys Maxwell 📚📝

I'm interested in programming because it helps me to automate some tasks and I love to learn about Eletromagnetism, Electronics and Electrical Machines 🤖💡

This is my personal repository for keeping notes of stuffs that I find useful and can help me (maybe you as well) sometimes.
